# Scottish Mythical Beasts

### General Info:
<p>This is a very simple React project.</p>
<p>The main concept was to present random facts about each beast, whenenever the mouse pointer is moved onto an element (in this case - the image).</p>
<p>My personal objective here was to get familiarized with React functionality, and present the user with some unknown aspects of Scottish folklore in a more interactive way. </p>
